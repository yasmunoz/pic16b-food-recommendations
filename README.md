## Abstract:
In order to provide variation to our users’ diets, we aim to create a webapp that allows users to easily find recipes based on the food items (ingredients) they enter. If they don’t feel like cooking, they could also use the restaurant recommender function to find a nice restaurant near them according to their preferences. 
This program would be good for people that struggle to eat/decide what to eat for themselves because it shows the user that they have options. 
 
## Deliverables:
Full success: A fully functional webapp with two main functions: a recipe and a restaurant recommender, based on the user’s preference. For the recipe recommender, a user can enter what they wish to be included in their final product, and also enter ingredients they wish to be excluded from it. They can also filter for specific recipes that fit under a category (such as “Mediterranean cuisine”). The restaurant recommender will ask the user if they would like to look for a specific type of food, then query restaurants near (how near is near?) the user’s geographical location. If the user does not enter a specific criteria, the recommender will randomly pick restaurant(s) for the user.
 
For both the recipe and restaurant recommender, the webapp will either return a list of choices or randomly present 1 choice (also according to user preference). Although a list of choices may sound appealing, sometimes the hard part of finding something to eat is actually deciding on something. 
 
Partial success: Our data in a partial success might be obtained from Kaggle instead of web scraped by ourselves. It could also be a functional recommender, but only accessible through terminal. 
 
Bonus success: Customizing recipes and restaurant recommendations down to the user’s personal diet, which would also benefit those with very specific diets.
 
## Resources:
* We will scrape recipe information from (a certain recipe website)
* Kaggle, for recipe information if web scraping doesn’t work.
 
## Tools/skills:
* Web scraping! For this project, we would have to collect a large amount of data from different websites.
* Sqlite3 and Pandas to manage our data.
* Heroku, to turn our webapp into an easily accessible url. 
* Plotly, for graphical data visualizations of places to eat and their locations.
* We will also need machine learning in order to determine which options ‘best fit’ the needs of the consumer. 
 
## What we’ll learn:
This project requires us to explore different web frameworks and as a result we will learn about these different frameworks and how to manipulate them in order to develop our unique website.
We will also learn how to efficiently collect data, then create and manipulate databases to be able to fit our specific scenarios using machine learning.
Throughout the project, we will learn how to work on and improve a webapp in a collaborative setting using GitHub as a living and evolving project. 
 
## Risks:
It may be more difficult to use in food deserts and could take a while for enough data to be collected to be completely customized.
 
## Ethics:
This could be less feasible for those that have food deserts where they are looking, since there is not as wide of a range of options for dietary needs. This also could be consumed by diet culture, and having the user be too concerned about sticking to their diet by not eating rather than going somewhere that does not have options that they want.
 
## Timeline:
February 10: Build our database/get all of our data together
February 17: Have all of the code for visualizations that will go on the website created (including but not limited to geographic data visualizations based on the location selected)
February 24: Have the ‘front end’ of our webapp created, with a machine learning algorithm that is not at its final stage
March 1st: Finish ML algorithm.
March 8th: Improve overall project for efficiency and visual appeal for its’ final stage for the class.
